## My personal Bash environment

To use it, follow these steps:

1. Install Hub: <https://hub.github.com/>
2. Run the following command: `git clone --recursive -j8 https://github.com/MrDrMcCoy/bash_env.git ${HOME}/bash_env`
3. Add this to your `~/.bashrc`:
    ```bash
    cd ${HOME}/bash_env
    source main
    cd -
    ```
4. Start a new session and enjoy!
